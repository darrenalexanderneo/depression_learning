# Depression Breakthrough.
A undergraduate natural language processing (NLP) project to identify various aspects and drivers of depression.

<h3> Summary </h3> 
With the abundance of depression related data on social media, we aim to be able to analyze the common sentiments on depressive Reddit threads as well as to be able to potentially detect threads that are considered depressive in nature, in order to flag these out for further attention by professionals. With different data mining techniques such as Topic Modelling and Classification, we hope to derive insights from these Reddit threads and ultimately, predict future posts on the different threads. <br> <br>
